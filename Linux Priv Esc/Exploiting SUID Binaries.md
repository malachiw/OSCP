### Find SUID binaries
find / -type f -perm -4001 -exec ls -h {} \; 2> /dev/null<br>
find / -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null


* Does the binary use other binaries without calling their full path?<br>
  Create a script named the same as the called binary and prepend path with this new script.<br>
  Use symbolic link: ln -s /bin/suidbinary target
